# Julia Function Bug: Zero Handling

This repository demonstrates a simple bug in a Julia function related to handling the case when input is zero. The function `myfunction` is designed to square positive numbers and negate negative numbers. However, it doesn't explicitly handle the case when the input is zero which may lead to unexpected results.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version.
